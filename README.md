# odin-recipes
This project is a recipe website using html. The skills I demonstrate are using elements to make a basic website with text, links, and lists. 

## Self Reflection
In this project I learned how to put together knowledge to create a site. I also learned more about Creative Commons Licences and how to give proper credit for using an image under it.
